# Internship Projects at CodSoft
Welcome to my GitHub page showcasing the projects I developed during my internship at Codsoft. This repository contains three major projects that I worked on, reflecting my learning journey and the skills I acquired. Below is an overview of each project, along with insights into my experiences and key takeaways from this internship.
#Projects Overview
# Credit Card Fraud Detection
PURPOSE:- This model's main purpose is to detect if the transaction made by the person was legit or was a fraud transactions.

TECHNOLOGIES: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn.

WORKING:- This works on Logistic regression which is a supervised learning algorithm used to predict the probability of a binary outcome (1/0, Yes/No, True/False) based on one or more predictor variables.

LEARNING OUTCOMES:- 
1. Learned about Logistic Regresion in Machine Learning and its application.
2. Improved my understanding of data manipulation using Pandas.
3. Improved my data manipulation and data cleansing.

# Sales Prediction Model
PURPOSE:- This model predicts the sales of a company in the upcoming years by taking out attributes from the previous years sales.

TECHNOLOGIES: Python, Pandas, Sklearn, Numpy, Matplot, Seaborn.

WORKING:- XGBRegressor uses gradient boosting, which builds an ensemble of decision trees sequentially. Each tree is trained to correct the errors made by the previous trees, thereby improving the model's performance iteratively.

LEARNING OUTCOMES:- 
1. Learned about Linear Dicison tree.
2. Improved my understanding of data manipulation using Pandas.
3. Improved my data manipulation and data cleansing.
4. Used data visualization to understand the data.
   
# Iris Flower Prediction
Purpose: This model's main aim is to classify the type of Flower by using the provived data.

TECHNOLOGIES: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn.

WORKING:- This works on Logistic KNeighborsClassifier by using the four parametters of the flower such as; length of petal, size, colour etc. The model can classify it in three types of flower.

LEARNING OUTCOMES:- 
1. Learned about KKNeighborsClassifier in sklearn
2. Worked on a biger set of data and trained a model with big data.
3. Applicable in real world cases.
